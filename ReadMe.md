# Getting And Cleaning Data - Course Project 20/06/2015

## Introduction

This repo contains my course project to  ["Getting And Cleaning Data"] 
course on [Coursera] taught by by Jeff Leek, PhD, Roger D. Peng, PhD, 
Brian Caffo, PhD.

There is a script called `run_analysis.R`. It contains all functions and 
code to create a tidy data set:

The workflow is as follows:

* Downloading the data[1]
* Merging the data tables
* Merging the labels and subjects to data tables
* Manipulating data
* Create the tidy data table and writing it to CSV file.


The `CodeBook.md` explains it more detailed.

A full description is available at the [site] where the original data is stored.
